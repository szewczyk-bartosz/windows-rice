# Windows Rice - a heurisitc take on the desktop

After spending a long time trying to set up different linux distros, window managers etc etc, I have ran into enough issues that I feel like using linux is lovely and all, but I don't have infinite time to fix problems

- Wifi not working
- Where do I set my themes again
- icons not working
- more networking problems
- can't run games that use EasyAntiCheat

I wanted a computer that just works

That being said, I don't think I could ever go back to the default windows experience, tiling WMs are just too beautiful and using the commandline for certain tasks is just too convenient and cool

Within this repo, I hope to document my journey of creating a linux tiling-wm-like experience whilst combining it with the ease of use and out-out-the-boxness of windows

I also want this to be a design blueprint for how somene's entire digital needs can be met, hence why I'll be listing what services I use for pretty much everything

## Installing windows 11 with a local account
SHIFT + F10 
Then typing "oobe\bypassnro" worked for me (after unplugging ethernet etc)
